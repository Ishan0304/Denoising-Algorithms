A rolling window collects observations into groups of $n$ size. The groups are shifted one observation at a time, creating a \"window\" that passes over the dataset, hence the name. Each observation is part of $n-1$ groups, except for observations very near the beginning or the end, which appear in fewer (although you may choose to anneal them). Any summary statistic can be used within the rolling window to aggregate the data, though the average is the most popular default option.\nThe simplest rolling window technique is to apply an average on a neighborhood. \nOne rolling window technique worth particular mention is the [median filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter).

These algorithms are generally known as **filters**, or sometimes \"digital filters\" (to distinguish from electrical analog filters).

Filters were designed in an era where compute was many orders of magnitude more expensive. They tend to make statistical assumptions about the underlying data which, although never entirely valid, leads to simple computations and fast implementations. Typical machine learning algorithms can take much longer to do the same work, but don't make assumptions about the data. Additionally they tend to be more familiar to the practioner.\n\n\n## Addendum\n\nAs the notebook [VSB Power Line Faults EDA + Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/timothycwillard/vsb-power-line-faults-eda-feature-engineering) points out, likely the strongest signal in the VSB Power Line Fault Detection competition dataset is the level of noise in various segments of the dataset. Denoising algorithms are relevant to the dataset because you can back out the level of noise in the dataset by comparing the original dataset with the smoothed version. Try using that as a feature for this competition."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
